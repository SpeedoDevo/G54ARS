>An excellent, well-written report demonstrating good insight, understanding and development of ideas considering potential issues on practical implementation. Some minor points to further improve it are:
> 1. Provide more detail in some functional aspects such as how do you determine that new (window) values are "different enough", describe what a 0-0 command is, and provide some discussion on Figs 1 and 2.
> 2. As opposed to the implementation described on page 4, Follow and Forage behaviours would ideally be completely independent such that "on line" state is not shared.
> 3. Lastly, when referring to the way the setpoint is callibrated,you mention the algorithm "Oscillates" a lot, perhaps you meant "loops" or "iterates" as your are referring to code execution.
